In my [previous post](/posts/do-the-scary-thing) I mentioned that there were a couple of opportunities on the horizon that I was being considered for.

I've known for a little while now, but today it was publicly [announced](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7300947749191987200/) that I'll be serving on the Program Committee for RailsConf 2025.  I don't think it's possible for me to mbe more excited about this.

RailsConf has been a huge part of my career and growth as a software developer.  I've met some amazing people, and become friends with people that I admire in the community.

I know that there's at least one job in my job history that I got because of my involvement at RailsConf.  One of the people involved in hiring for the job looked me up and saw that I had been a Guide in the Scholars and Guides program the previous year.  He told me later on that seeing that was what sealed the deal for him on wanting to have me on his team.

So even though this will be the final RailsConf, I'm just so excited for it.  

The CFP for RailsConf closes tomorrow.  Which means a big chunk of my work on the Program Committee will start almost immediately afterwards as we all start reviewing the submissions.  I'm excited to help shape the program based on the CFP submissions.  I'm really curious to see what people are learning and talking about and wanting to show to the rest of the community.

I'm looking forward to hanging out with old friends, and hopefully making some new ones.

I'm excited to hopefully get to explore Philadelphia a little bit, since I've never visited Philly before.

I'm just...I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it.  

And yes, I'm actively singing that song right now.
