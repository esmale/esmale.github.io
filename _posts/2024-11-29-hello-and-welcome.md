I've long been quietly amused by the fact that even after two decades of work as a web developer, I had not yet created anything just for myself. So this blog is my attempt to try and rectify that and start something new.  Maybe even a few new things will come out of this.  (I have a few nebulous ideas right now, nothing concrete yet.)

So anyways, I figure that I should start this thing off by actually introducing myself.  

My name is David Hill, and I live in Tampa, Florida with my wife and two kids.  I started working as a Web Developer at a PHP shop, and wound up working full time and going to school part time to finish my college degree.  Once I finally graduated, we moved to be near my wife's family, which ultimately led me to the job where I was introduced to Ruby on Rails.

I've been pretty committed to working with Ruby on Rails ever since then.  I love the Ruby language, and I love Rails.  And for a long time it was primarily the love of the technology and tools that kept me going.

More recently, however, I've found that the community around those technologies, my #RubyFriends, is what energizes me even more.  A lot of what I hope to talk about and highlight on this site are examples of what I think makes the Ruby community so awesome.

Aside from programming, I have a wide array of other very nerdy interests.  I love reading fantasy and science fiction novels, with Brandon Sanderson being far and away my favorite author.  Fair warning: I'll be talking about him **A LOT** next week.

I'm also an avid fan of boardgames, particularly games that also have a very nerdy science fiction or fantasy bend to them.  Games like _Terraforming Mars_, _Last Light_, or _Wyrmspan_.  As I try out new games, or host game nights with friends, I'll probably share details about those events here as well.

Finally, I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  My faith is an important part of who I am and why I do what I do. So when I have experiences that I would categorize as "spiritual" or "religious" they might find their way onto this blog as well. 

All this to say, I intend for this blog to primarily be a place where I talk about programming and related topics, I'm also not going to shy away from sharing about these other things that I love.  

Thanks for sticking around through this somewhat rambling introduction.  I'll have more to say tomorrow!
